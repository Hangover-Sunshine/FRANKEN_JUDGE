# FRANKEN JUDGE
Hangover Sunshine's entry into the 2024 edition of the Game Maker Toolkit's Game Jam.

## Pitch

A spooky REIGNS-like judicial simulator where Frankenstein is the judge.

## What is FRANKEN JUDGE?

FRANKEN JUDGE is a spooky REIGNS-like judicial simulator where the infamous monster created by Frankenstein dons the robe and wig of a judge. Take control of this undead barrister and help him survive. Balance his reputation with various citywide factions and weigh your options when declaring which societal class prevails. Become the greatest judge for the people, made from the flesh of the people!

## Design

FRANKEN JUDGE was made and submitted as part of the Game Maker's Toolkit 2024 Game Jam. The theme for this jam was Built To Scale. As part of this theme, the duo at Hangover Sunshine felt inspired to take the term literally:

`"Built, with the purpose, to scale."`

This concept led to having the player balancing the scales of justice as the perfect judge, deciding the outcomes of each courtroom case. To further emphasize the weight of each decision, your rulings affect your reputation with three distinct citywide factions. These social classes have different values and beliefs, and repeated poor judgments can lead to your downfall. You were built by Frankenstein to weigh in on and scale these court cases, making you theoretically the perfect man for the job.
